It was evaluated what the indicator shown from either anxiety, depression, or listed as either. Listed is also the state they preside (including the United States if not mentioned and the District of Columbia) and the group if given. The group can vary, they can be from the state, sex, age, by education, race/ethnicity. This can later be split into smaller subgroups from the group. For example by state -> California or age->30-39.\n",
